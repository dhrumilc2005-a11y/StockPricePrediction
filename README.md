# StockPricePrediction (Python-DataScience)

A Stock Price Prediction project built using Python and popular Data Science libraries. This application loads historical stock market data and applies machine learning and deep learning models to forecast future stock closing prices based on past behavior. It’s ideal for data science learning, time‑series forecasting, and experimenting with AI‑driven models.

📘 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical price data. This involves:

Loading and preprocessing historical stock data

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends

Feature engineering to prepare time‑series sequences

Training predictive models like Linear Regression or LSTM

Evaluating accuracy and plotting forecasts

🚀 Features

✔ Load and clean stock price data (CSV or API)
✔ Support for multiple ML models (Regression, LSTM, etc.)
✔ Train / Test split for forecasting
✔ Visualizations of price trends and predictions
✔ Error evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
✔ Interactive or script‑based workflow
